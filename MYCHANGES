Changes made for submission 2a
==============================

The following is a list of files, each followed by the changes we made to that particular file.


Makefile.cfg
------------

1. Changed the line
	CC=gcc
to
	CC=gcc-4.6
to ensure that our code uses exactly gcc-4.6 (and not a later or earlier version)


scanner.ll
----------

1. Added lexemes for if, else and goto
2. Added actions for each of the above lexemes


parser.yy
---------

1. Added a line specifying that IF, ELSE and GOTO are tokens

2. Rewrote the grammar:

	a. Removed executable_statement and executable_statement_list
	b. Added a number of new nonterminals
	c. Added appropriate %type lines at the top of parser.yy

   We plan to revert these changes in the future to comply with the given grammar rules if need be. The only reason we changed the given rules was to force ourselves to write everything from scratch and learn more about parsing and context-free grammars in the process.

3. Added precedence rules for '<', '>' and '=' to ensure no shift/reduce conflicts in our grammar

4. Commented out the C++ base code as mentioned in the problem statement

5. Added commented-out actions for some of the rules to prevent type-association and type-clash warnings while running bisonc++ on the parser.yy file.


Changes made for submission 2b
==============================

This is a list of files. Below each file we have listed the changes made to that file.


scanner.ll
----------

1. Added lexemes to recognise comparison operators


parser.yy
---------

1. Wrote action routines for appropriate routines

2. Defined tokens for the comparison operators (as opposed to before, where they were META_CHARs)


parser.h
--------

1. Defined a set of Basic Blocks seen so far (bb_made) and a vector of 'requested' Basic Blocks (bb_requested). A Basic Block is said to be 'requested' if somewhere in the program, there is a Goto instructing the program to jump to that Basic Block.

2. Added code to check that the parser does not validate a program in which a Basic Block is being requested when it has not been seen. To do this we iterate over bb_requested and check if each number in it is also present in the set bb_made.


ast.hh and ast.cc
-----------------

1. Added Comparison_Ast, Goto_Ast and If_Ast classes.

2. Defined evaluate, print_ast and other methods for each of these classes.

3. Also added a function 'successor_found' which is explained in the next section.


local-environment.hh and local-environment.cc
---------------------------------------------

1. Defined an Enum for possible return types of an Ast. At this stage, we have only three possible return types: int, void and skip. The skip_result return type is returned by If_Ast and Goto_Ast


basic-block.hh and basic-block.cc
---------------------------------

1. Defined successor_found function. This function checks if a basic block has one of the following ASTs at its end: an If_Ast, a Goto_Ast or a Return_Ast. This function is called on the last block of a procedure. If it returns false, an error is reported. Internally, this function calls the 'successor_found' virtual function of the Ast class.

2. Modified the 'evaluate' function for the Basic_Block class.


procedure.hh and procedure.cc
-----------------------------

1. Added a function 'get_jump_bb' which takes as input a number representing a basic block and returns a pointer to the basic block with that number, or NULL if it cannot find such a basic block.

2. Modified the 'evaluate' function to account for skip_result being returned from an Ast. In such a case, we use 'get_jump_bb' to jump to the requested block.


Changes made for submission 3a
==============================

In this submission we added support for tokens for 'float' and 'double' data types, and for arithmetic operators +, -, / and * as well as unary minus. Below is a list of files, and below each file is a list of changes we made to that file.


scanner.ll
----------

1. Added a token named ARITHOP that captures the lexemes -, +, / and *.

2. Added a token named FNUM to capture floating point numbers. The action routine for FNUM returns the token Parser::FLOAT_NUMBER.

3. Added tokens FLOAT and DOUBLE to detect the declaration type of float and double numbers respectively.


parser.yy
---------

1. Constants can now also be FLOAT_NUMBERs and DOUBLE_NUMBERs, not just INTEGER_NUMBERs.

2. Added many new nonterminals and expansions to capture multiplication/division and plus/minus expressions.

3. Since typecasting is now also possible, we are distinguishing between 'typecast' and 'non-typecast' atoms. An atom is either a variable, a constant, or a CFG expression wrapped in parentheses.

To capture the difference between typecast and non-typecast atoms we have a nonterminal called 'var_const'. 'var_const' expands into either 'var_const_plain' or 'typecast' 'var_const_plain'.


ast.hh
------

1. Added an Enum for arithmetic operators called Arith_Op_Enum. It can take any one of the values PLUS_OP, MINUS_OP, DIV_OP, MUL_OP.


Changes made for submission 3b
==============================


ast.hh and ast.cc
------------------

1. Wrote the Ast classes for following:
	a. Arithmetic_Ast --- Ast class for arithmetic expressions
	b. Typecast_Ast --- Ast class for type-casting variables and expression values
	c. UnaryMinus_Ast --- Ast class for applying Unary minus operator to any value.

2. Added features to check for compatibility of lhs and rhs operands before the operation and raise appropirate error.

3. Modified evaluate function of Return_Ast to exit the program normally.

4. Added a template class for Number_Ast<float>


local-evironment.cc and local-environment.hh
---------------------------------------------

1. One nice problem that we faced was that an instance of Eval_Result or any of its derived class could only return an intger as a result. But since we also had to deal with single precision floats in addition to ints, we needed a generic return type to return the result value according to the context. So we modified the Eval_result class and its derivatives to provide the result as a union. The union has two fields, 'int_val' and 'float_val'. Thus, result for any calculation can now be calculated and its integer and float variants can be extracted out according the situation.


program.cc
-----------

1. Set the precision of output stream as fixed 2 digits after decimal to print out the floats correctly.


parser.yy
-----------

1. Added actions routines for all the required non terminals in this file and integrated them to work correctly.
	New actions added for:
	a. arithmetic_expr
	b. mul_div_expr
	c. Typecast of expressions, variables and constants etc.


Changes made for submission 4a
==============================


In this part we added support for tokenization of programs that contain function declaration, definition and calling.


scanner.ll
----------

1. Commas are now meta characters, as they can appear when we are declaration, defining or calling a function. So we added ',' to the list of meta characters. Previously they were treated as illegal characters.

2. To support void functions we added 'void' as a token.

parser.yy
---------

1. The lexer can return 'void' tokens, so we added a new token name "VOID".

2. Previously, 'program' was just a declaration statement list followed by the 'main' procedure. But now since we have multiple procedures, a program looks like this:

	<global variable declaration>* <procedure declaration>* <procedure_definition>+

So we changed the expansion for the 'program' nonterminal, and added other nonterminals to support the new program structure.

3. Until now, we only had the main function, which was a void function. So the return statement could only ever be 'return ;'. But now that we have procedures with different return types we need to capture return statements of the form:
	
	return <expression>? ;

So we created a nonterminal for return statements and wrote appropriate expansions.


Changes made for submission 4b
==============================

Parser.yy
----------

1. Few more non-terminals(function_call, parameter, parameter_list etc.) to parse function prototypes, parameter arguments and definitions added.
2. Correct actions embedded at correct positions in the language definition.
3. Actions for some existing non-terminals( return_stmt, declaration, function etc.) modified to integrate the newly added functionality correctly.
4. Appropirate messages to be shown on detection of errors related with functions,their calls, declaration etc. added.

Ast.hh and Ast.cc
------------------

1. One new ast for funciton_call i.e. "function_call_Ast" added and defined.
2. Evaluate and print_ast of some other ast's(return_Ast, if_Ast) modified accordingly to deal with the new implementations.

local_environment.hh and local_environment.cc
----------------------------------------------

1. One more result "goto_result" type added in "Result_Enum" list. Now the evaluation results for goto_statement and skip_results are clearly separated.

Procedure.hh and Procedure.cc
-----------------------------

1. Evaluate function of a procedure modified.
2. New function "evaluate_in_env(args)" added which basically evaluates a procedure given the environment as an argument. This function is used to evaluate the results for function calls in the program. We create a suitable environent required by a funtion call and provide it as an argument to this function.
3.Two data members, "local_arg_table" which is a symbol table of procedure arguments and "arg_string_list" which is a list of argument parameter strings added.
4.Some member functions added. (match_arg_types(args), match_arg_list(args) etc.)

Parser.h and Parser.ih
-------------------------

1. One method "check_return_data_types(args)" added.

Program.cc
-----------

1. The member method get_procedure_map(args) modified.
